        <p>Buses are the most frequently available and used for travelling. there are many types of buses
made available in the market according to the class of the public.<br> As per the needs of the
public ,there are many features being provided in the buses. Such as AC coach,NON-AC
coach,sleeper,semi sleeper etc. Apart from providing these facilities in their buses the problem
here arises about the tickets i.e; everyone needs the tickets. <br>But itâ€™s not possible. The buses
which will register on our system will have the option to give their customers an option to
select the seats of the bus according to their wish as many places depending on the availability.
Making the system more useful unique tickets will be generated as its seats confirmed.<br> Here
we are with a system which can facilitate the users to which they can get their seats prior.
As staff will decide the seat availability and here we have other users like the staff of the bus
and driver with the owner who together collaborates in smooth functioning of the bus ticket
booking system.</p>
